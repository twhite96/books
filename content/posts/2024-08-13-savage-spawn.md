> A book by Jonathan Kellerman

The first couple pages of this book went down smooth, like a good greek yogurt. There were good points all-around and I found myself nodding along in agreement with Kellerman, especially the parts about the dubiousness of "FBI Profiling".

Then, Kellerman does a complete 180, with dated talking points on putting anyone who commits one crime away forever. The 11 and 13 year olds who committed mass murder with guns should be tossed in jail, do not pass go, even if they were literal children.

The three strike rule in California which has [disproportionally affects minorities](https://law.stanford.edu/three-strikes-project/three-strikes-basics/#:~:text=Statistics%20from%20the%20California%20Department,nothing%20to%20improve%20public%20safety) and despite the claim it was supposed to put away only *violent criminals* such as rapists and murderers, that [wasn't the case when it was enacted](https://law.stanford.edu/three-strikes-project/three-strikes-basics/#:~:text=However%2C%20today%2C%20more%20than%20half%20of%20inmates%20sentenced%20under%20the%20law%20are%20serving%20sentences%20for%20nonviolent%20crimes).

I am not sure what kind of credentials Mr. Kellerman has to speak on psychopathy or law, but it is clear to me he isn't qualified to speak on either one.

Thinking that Kellerman was some sort of academic is a *my bad* when picking up this book without thinking critically about who wrote it and the angle he was coming from.

Kellerman writes crime novels that are just as easy to digest as this book, so if you're looking for an easy read full of the copaganda you should expect from crime novels, read one of Kellerman's novels. Pass on this one.

Highlight: *distinctions between good and evil, excuses about how we all sin from time to time, how there’s really no such thing as abnormal, merely variants along a subtle continuum. True, very few of us are saints. But that has nothing to do with serious crime. Or with psychopaths. Bad people are really different*
