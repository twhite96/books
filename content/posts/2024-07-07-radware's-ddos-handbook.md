description: A great book for new red teamers.
title: "Book 2: Radware's DDoS Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Everything You Need to Know about DDoS Attacks"
---

I finished this book in one sitting and found it an interesting insight into how blue teamers need to think about attacks. From a pentester's perspective, it gave me a whole bunch of ideas for tooling to build.

One of the most interesting parts of the book was learning about Slowiris and R.U.D.Y. (R U dead yet?) DoS attacks that slowly attack a network with large HTTP requests or with extremely large form POST requests, which are hard to detect for blue teams.

I decided to try my hand on building such a tool which I'll be making public on [my instance of Forgejo](https://projects.0x8c.run/explore) once it is finished.
