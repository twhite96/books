A book for beginners.
<!--truncate-->

When I purchased this book, I wanted a brief overview of the essentials, libraries I may not have heard about or had come across. Unfortunately my definition was too... *narrow*, *niche* maybe because while these libraries are technically *essential*, they are well known to anyone who has been programming for a while.

If you already have familiarity with Python this may not be the book you want.
